	<div>We have 2 candidates for President this year, incumbent, Doug Hall and challenger, Tony Kyles.</div>

	<div>Doug has been the President of the CTXPHC this past year and has held several positions on the Board of Directors for the past several years.  Tony is a newcomer to our club but comes with an extensive background in managing philanthropic organizations and served as part of Philanthropy this year.</div>

	<p>Quite simply, I am running for my second term as President because I want to finish what I started.  To take this club back to the prominence it once enjoyed.  A club that other clubs would want to model themselves after.  To bring all the members of this club closer together.  And to increase on a continual basis our presence in the community and our commitment to our causes. 
	<p>We made some very good strides this year despite some early setbacks.  And it is those strides I want to expand on and move forward with.  There is still a lot of work to be done.  And make no mistake, it will take someone with almost ten years Board experience in the roles of Philanthropy, Vice President, and President.  Someone known throughout the South Region as well as within this club as someone who shoots straight and does not sugar coat, someone who does his best to represent the club as whole while keeping the back of each individual member in the process, and someone known to stay open minded to any ideas or suggestions while at the same time standing his ground on issues he feels the strongest about.  That of course means that I will never be the most popular person to everyone at one time.  But I promise that I will be popular to everyone of you at some time or another.  It is part of the job and you need someone who understands that and will move forward using his best judgment. 
	<p>I like to think I have done well for this club during my time on the Board. Moving into the Presidency was not an easy transition.  It is a lot of hard work and it came at a difficult time in our club's history.  A lot of folks told me I was crazy for taking it on.  A lot of others have told me I am even crazier for wanting to do it again.  Maybe, maybe not.  But it answers the question of my commitment to this club and to every single one of you.  This is a passion.  
	<p>I have seen a lot of progress.  Some of it in some unlikely places that others may have missed. And I want to keep that going.
	<p>Thank you for your consideration

	<p>In accepting the nomination for the president of Central Texas Parrothead Club, I am greatly excited to become a more integral part of this PHlock and learn more from all the great people who have come before me and to those who may come after me. 
	<p>In joining any organization whether it be on a professional or personal level I have always understood that one must realize it is not up to one individual but many that will help that organization to achieve its goals and visions.  I hope to be able to bring a variety of life experiences to the presidency in making our club one of the most successful throughout the great Parrot Head Nation. 
	<p>From a young age I became involved in and saw the benefits of community service, working during my teenage years helping out local food pantries, Toy’s for Tots, and other worthy causes that gave me real world exposure to community outreach.  I continued this pattern through my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and even more so when I became the president of the School of Business’s Marketing Society Mu Kappa Tau.  Starting off as a member, being elected as the Social Chair and eventually being promoted to President allowed me to understand the different roles and responsibilities that go into making an non-profit organization successful, from fund-raising to marketing/membership, and again community philanthropic works. 
	<p>After graduating from school and working in a variety of industries over the last 10 years such as health care, insurance and financial services, and even security, I have been blessed to have been exposed to so many wonderful people from different backgrounds which have helped me to gain a better perspective of not only who I am but what I can accomplish by myself as well as with the help of others. 
	<p>If elected to serve on the 2013 Board of Directors for the CTXPHC, I will make it my goal to keep the lessons and people that have created this wonderful club in my mind as we move forward in expanding the great successes that the organization has achieved.  With that being said, there are always opportunities for future new endeavors that will expand the club’s abilities to serve even more members and community partners and am excited to be a part of initiating those endeavors. 
	<p>I look forward to answering any questions and/or concerns about my candidacy and have provided both my email and phone below knowing that in order to excel in a leadership role one must be open to all viewpoints and perspectives in obtaining the necessary information to make the most informed and best suited decisions for a group cause.

	<p>I thank you for the opportunity and promise that I will do everything in my power to exceed the expectations that this Presidency and organization calls for.

	<p>I'm excited about the prospect of serving as the Vice President of the Central Texas Parrothead Club.  I've been a member of this club for almost 12 years and take great pride in our organization.
	<p>I would like to make the role of Vice President an active position, not only a supporting role to the President, by adding a focus on special projects for the club as well as an active "helping hand" to each of my fellow Board members. For special projects, I would like to focus on member appreciation programs to help new members become actively involved in our club, as well as increase the level of engagement from current members. My ideas include:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Member Appreciation Program:</strong>A rewards and recognition program to spotlight the efforts of general members.  Many of our members put in a lot of effort in our club and should be recognized.  I have several ideas for this program and look forward to finding out what your ideas are to ensure the rewards and recognition are things you will enjoy.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>New Member Ambassador Program:</strong>I would work closely with the Membership Director to make this a great success.  I've been part of other clubs where each new member is assigned to an "Ambassador"(a seasoned club member) who's role, among other things, would be to take an new member under their wing and integrate them into the phlock.  The Ambassador would send personal emails encouraging the new members to attend events and would act as host to the new member at two Happy Hours introducing them to other members.  This would help new members get to know everyone and ensure they feel welcome and a part of the group.</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Along with these two new programs, I feel strongly that the Vice President position should actively help other officers with their projects.  I will offer my assistance to the other Board Members and committees to help with what ever they need!
	<p>Thank you for considering me for the Vice President role.  I would love to serve our club again next year.

	<p>I am excited for the opportunity to continue as your Membership Director!  

	<p>It wasn't that long ago when I was a new addition to the parrothead phamily, and I remember how it feels to enter a new group with established traditions and long time relationships.  I plan to use these memories to provide a welcoming environment that would promote inclusiveness for all.  I am very enthusiastic about promoting club growth and envision implementing active recruiting into everything the club does.  

	<p>My background of over 20 years is in the customer service and marketing arena.  I am presently an executive assistant to the president of a printing company.  My years of promotional experience, and my current production connections have enabled me to
	<ul>
		<li>create a membership tri-fold display to promote our club at events</li>
		<li>create an informative, glossy CTXPHC pamphlet</li>
		<li>print colorful business cards and raffle tickets</li>
		<li>and implement special occasion ECards to let members know we are thinking about them during a life celebration or a life crisis.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Before moving back home to Texas, about three years ago, I had been working in the recruiting field.  Promoting products, services, and people are second nature to me.  I would like to put my work experience and passion for this club together in order to build up membership and broaden its horizons.  

	<p>As Membership Director, I plan to continue working with our Web Master in creating specialized membership management tools on the new club website.  This will enable the current and future Membership Directors to be able to keep more accurate records and pull reports for various needs of our club and PHiP.  

	<p>I would like to create a phun and phabulous “Welcome-Aboard-New-Member Packet”.  I believe that the sooner we engage new members in all things Parrothead, the more involved they will become, thus strengthening the success of our organization and deepening our relationships.  

	<p>I feel I have grown and matured so much this year as Membership Director and would like the chance to expand on that growth in 2013 and continue to be a viable PHC representative.

		<p>I've served on the Board of Directors of the Central Texas Parrothead Club as Treasurer for the last year and have attempted to keep the club on a firm financial footing.  I feel I have been successful in this regard.  

		<p>One of my accomplishments from this past year is the consolidate our bank accounts into a locally owned credit union savings account.  This saves us all of the monthly fees we had been paying for the last 14 years.

		<p>I have a background in finance, having spent 20 years as a professional commodity trader.

		<p>What can I say? I like numbers.

		<p>I would like the opportunity to continue to serve as your Treasurer.
